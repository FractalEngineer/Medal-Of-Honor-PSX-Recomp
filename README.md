## Retro Launcher

You can run this title **standalone** (download the release zip, point it at
your disc, play), or manage installs, updates, and disc/BIOS wiring with
**[Retro Launcher](https://github.com/RetroPortingToolKit/Retro-Launcher)** —
the Retro Compilation Manager hub for self-compiling recomps.

Retro checks for updates, installs the prebuilt release zips, and automates
BIOS/ROM/save plumbing so you are not stuck repeating each game’s first run by hand.

## Legal

You must own the original game. Disc images under `disc/` are gitignored and
must never be committed. Retail BIOS dumps are not redistributed and no C
derived from one may be committed; releases run on the bundled MIT OpenBIOS.

`generated/` (the recompiled game C) **is committed**: releases ship the
compiled game, built by CI from that tree. Regenerate and commit it whenever
seeds or the framework pin change.

Default app icon: `assets/psxrecomp.ico` (and `.png` / `.svg`) — Retro-themed controller mark from `psxrecomp/assets/`. Windows builds embed it via `APP_ICON`.

Optional box art under `launcher_assets/img/` may come from
[libretro-thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/libretro-thumbnails)
(`Named_Boxarts`); see `BOXART_SOURCE.txt` when present.

## Quick start (dev)

For the local Quest 3 / VDXR build, connect Virtual Desktop and double-click
`RunVR.bat` in the project folder. It starts normally in VR: boot videos,
main menu and briefing use a comfortable native-screen surface, and gameplay
switches to genuine per-eye rendering. No save state is required. Left stick
navigates menus; A or right trigger confirms, B goes back. Accepted world scale,
tracked rifle, movement/combat controls and pause distance remain enabled.
It runs until you close the game; startup errors stay visible in the console.

Optional: `RunVR.bat -Slot 5` explicitly loads the enemy test save.
`RunVR.bat -Build` rebuilds before normal boot. The default executable is
`build-release/Medal_of_Honor__Recompiled.exe`. VR disables desktop VSync to
avoid a second wait; the guest real-time speed cap remains active. The
`-DesktopVSyncDiagnostic` option restores VSync only for comparison.

Framework pin `5bafeebf` includes the matching native VR startup support.

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
./psxrecomp/tools/ci/build_emitters.sh
python3 psxrecomp/psxrecomp_cli.py generate \
  --config game.toml --project-root . --disc disc/<your>.cue
git add generated && git commit -m "Regenerate game C"
cmake -S . -B build-release -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-release --target psx-runtime
```

Releases: tag `vX.Y.Z` (or run the *Release builds* workflow). CI builds the
committed `generated/` C on Linux, Windows and macOS and attaches
`moh-<version>-<platform>.zip`, the compiled game. Locally:
`scripts/package_release.sh build-release linux-x64`.

## Symbols

Progressive map: `symbols.toml` → `python3 tools/sync_symbols.py` →
`psx_symbols.h` (`PSX_FN_*`). See `psxrecomp/docs/SYMBOLS.md`.

## Framework pins

Submodule gitlinks (`psxrecomp`, optional `recomp-ui`, nested `recomp-net`)
are authoritative. `framework_pins.txt` is an optional scaffold snapshot;
release CI logs SHAs with `record_pins.sh` but builds whatever the gitlinks
resolve to. Bump submodules deliberately — do not float on `main`/`master`
in release CI.
